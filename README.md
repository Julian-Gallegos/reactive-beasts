# Practice making React actually Reactive with Horned Beasts

## This project uses React components, props, states, and event handlers to update the page, adding a heart to a beast each time it is liked.
  The project also utilizes React-Bootstrap's Cards to give it a clean design.

### This project is deployed using netlify: [Here's a like to its active page](https://playful-tartufo-2fd636.netlify.app/)

## Time sheet:  As an earlier commit message pointed out, I followed along during lecture and completed most of this without actually looking at the lab requirements, so my time sheets were not noted down as I worked, technically the whole thing took me about an hour? but after already getting the event handler component constructor code written down it took me less than a minute to figure out how to add votes to the beasts when their button is clicked. I will try to be more careful of tracking time in the future.
